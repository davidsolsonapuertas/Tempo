## Description
A music app that creates playlists based on song durations to match the duration of a user's task, as inputted in the app.

## Android Requirements
- A completed Recycler View with a custom adapter

- Integration with an API created by backend with use of OkHTTP and Moshi.

- Use of two 3rd party libraries (We've covered a little bit of Firebase, showcased Glide, or feel free to explore: here are others)

- At the minimum, three fully functional fragments with some system of navigation.
  
We have two recycler views: One for the playlist displaying songs, another one for a list of playlist.
  
We used OkHTTP3, the Spotify OAuth API and Glide
  
We have four functional fragments: One to login, another one to input the hours and minutes, another one to show the playlist, another one to show the playlists saved, and another one to edit the playlist name.
  
## Backend Requirements
### At least 4 routes (1 must be GET, 1 must be POST, 1 must be DELETE)

List of our 4 most important routes in the app:

  - GET /tempo/playlist/<session_token>
  Get all previously favorited playlists from database

  - POST /tempo/playlist/
  Create new playlist from Spotify w/ specified length

  - POST /tempo/playlist/<playlist_id>/edit/
  Edit name of favorited playlist

  - DELETE /tempo/playlist/<playlist_id>/
  Unfavorite and delete playlist from database

### At least 2 tables in database with a relationship between them

List of our 3 tables used in the app:

  Table of users
  - 1-to-many relationship w/ playlists

  Table of playlists
  - Many-to-1 relationship w/ users
  - 1-to-many relationship w/ songs

  Table of songs
  - Many-to-1 relationship w/ playlists


### API specification explaining each implemented route

POST /tempo/playlist/
```
Endpoint for creating a new playlist from Spotify with specified playtime

Returns:
    json: JSON containing list of tracks with total playtime of specified length.
    The returned JSON is the same as the one listed on Spotify's API for getting several tracks at once:
    https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-several-tracks
```

GET /tempo/playlist/<session_token>
```
Endpoint for getting all favorited playlists of user using their Spotify id.

Args:
    session_token (string): session token for authorization
    
No request body.

Returns: json of list of user's playlists
```

GET /tempo/playlist/<playlist_id>/
```
Endpoint for getting a list of tracks in a playlist using the playlist's id.

Args:
    playlist_id (int): id of the playlist

No request body.

Returns: json of list of tracks (see api)
```

POST /tempo/playlist/<session_token>/favorite/
```
Endpoint for "favoriting a playlist" by adding playlist for user (using their session_token) 
to playlists table.

Args:
    session_token (string): current session_token of the user
    
Request body:
{
    "tracks": [
        <spotify_id> (string),
        <spotify_id> (string),
        ...],
    "length": <length of playlist> (int)
}

Returns: new favorited playlist as json
```

POST /tempo/playlist/<playlist_id>/edit/

Args:
    playlist_id (int): id of the playlist
    
No request body.

Returns: returns success message
```

### Implementation of images and/or authentication (only 1 required)

We utilized session tokens to store Spotify authentication, which was then used to create playlists from personalized recommendations.

## Design Requirements
The design consists of six screens: login, home, playlist information (with icons), playlist naming, saved playlists, and playlist information (without icons). The features include signing in via Spotify, entering a desired playlist duration, creating a playlist of the specified duration, naming playlists, saving playlists, and viewing saved playlists. 

The design started with low-fidelity sketches of the main screens: logging in, inputting playlist duration, displaying playlist information, and displaying saved playlists. The designs were then translated to medium-fidelity sketches and explorations of how the screens may look like. Finally, the designs were finalized in high-fidelity, complete with prototyping of visual designs and element interactions. The interactions involved creating flows for users to go from signing in to seeing a generated playlist of appropriate duration. The visual design involved prominent use of the font Gotham Pro and the colors green, gray, black, and whiteâ€”with more information detailed in the accompanying UI Kit.
